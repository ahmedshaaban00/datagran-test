# Datagran Test

A ReactJS test for Datagran Frontend Vacancy.

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

## Pages

You'll find that there are 3 pages:

- Home (/)
- Line Graph (/line-graph)
- Posts (/posts)

and you can navigate to them either by changing it in the url or using the nav menu in the header of the website.
